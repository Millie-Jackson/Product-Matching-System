# Product Matching System

A prototype that compares shopping lists across supermarkets using AI-based fuzzy matching.  
Runs on sample data, but designed for real-world use.

Built by Millie Jackson @Nested{Loop}

##  Features
- Smart Matching using TF-IDF or SBERT
- Understands weights (e.g. "600g", "1.2kg")
- Optional value-based matching (price per gram)
- Total price per store + itemised breakdown
- Built-in test set for model evaluation
- CSV download of results

---

## How It Works

**1. Text Cleaning**  
Lowercase, remove symbols, normalise spacing

**2. Quantity Parsing**  
Extract weights (e.g., "1.2kg") and convert to grams

**3. TF-IDF Embedding**  
Represent product names as vectors

**4. Matching Logic**  
Combine name similarity + size penalty to rank best candidates

---

## Example Inputs
Paste a shopping list like:

```
600g Chicken Breast
Tofu Block 400g
Cheese Slices
```

Adjust the confidence threshold or switch methods to see differences.

## Evaluation Mode
- Use the evaluation tool at the bottom of the app to:
- Compare TF-IDF vs SBERT
- See accuracy on a test dataset
- Download evaluation CSV
